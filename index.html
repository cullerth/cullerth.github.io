          <h2>NCSU Libraries Fellow</h2>

          <p>I'm an N.C. State University Libraries Fellow working in Digital Library Initiatives and Learning Spaces and Services. As part of Digital Library Initiatives, I am addressing challenges in recruiting candidates for technical positions in libraries via the development, delivery, and assessment of an annual symposium for first-year LIS students to prepare them for entry-level opportunities in library technology upon graduation. As part of Learning Spaces & Services, I oversee the instruction program for the Libraries' new Innovation Studio, wherein we invite the campus community to engage critically with what it means to be an innovator by using the interdisciplinary practice of futures thinking to inspire creative problem-solving. </p>
